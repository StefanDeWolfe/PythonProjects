===== Intro =====

San Francisco's International Airport (KSFO) continuously tries
to improve the quality of its flight estimates by 
analyzing data from past flights and 
figuring out the root-cause of outliers and inaccurate estimates. 
In order to do this the teams that are tasked to solve this problem 
need to figure out ways of finding those outliers in their data.

For the purpose of this interview question, 
imagine that you are one of the engineers working on this problem. 
One of your colleagues suggested during a meeting that a good first step on finding those outliers would be 
categorize past flight information by departure airport (e.g. the airport that a plane departs from to arrive at KSFO)

and focus on the ones whose flight duration varies the most. 
Your team decided that this idea is worth pursuing and you're tasked with implementing it.

Your goal is to write a small program that utilizes the OpenSky public API and 
prints the 5 most varied flight duration data from flights that arrived in KSFO the past 3 days, 
categorized by departure airport.
'''
'''
Here is an example of the output of such a utility:

    ---------------------------------------------------
    Interval [2021-03-08 18:03:24, 2021-03-11 18:03:24]
    ---------------------------------------------------
    Airport Code | (max - min flight duration)
    ---------------------------------------------------
    LFPG         | 23:27:18
    KORD         | 5:20:06
    KDEN         | 4:16:37
    VIDP         | 1:03:25
    KEWR         | 0:44:26
'''

''' Interpreting the above data we can see that in the past 3 days
we saw a big outlier in which the slowest flight from LFPG
(Charles de Gaulle in Paris) was more than 23 hours slower than
the quickest flight from that same airport.

Rules/constraints:
* Print the 5 departure airports in sorted order (the airport
  with the maximum flight difference should appear at the top
  and the rest shall follow in descending order).
* Limit the output to 5 departure airports
* Print actual difference in time between the longest and the
  shortest flight duration.

Your output does not need to match the above example, The example
mostly exists to explain the problem and act as a guide to what
what we are looking for. If you have better ideas of how to display
the data, please do!

You should implement this in whatever language you're most
comfortable with -- just make sure your code is production
quality, well designed, and easy to read.

Finally, please help us by keeping this question and your
answer secret so that every candidate has a fair chance in
future Delphix interviews.

''' ===== Steps =====

    1.  Choose the language you want to code in from the menu
        labeled "Plain Text" in the top right corner of the
        screen. You will see a "Run" button appear on the top
        left -- clicking this will send your code to a Linux
        server and compile / run it. Output will appear on the
        right side of the screen.
        
        For information about what libraries are available for
        your chosen language, see:

          https://coderpad.io/languages

    2.  Pull up the documentation for the API you'll be using:

         https://openskynetwork.github.io/opensky-api/rest.html

    3. The API has most of its examples using authentication
        credentials like so:

          https://USERNAME:PASSWORD@opensky-network.org/api/flights/arrival?airport=KSFO..etc..

        You don’t need actual credentials to use the API. For
        the same example request show above just remove the
        “USERNAME:PASSWORD@” part like so:

          https://opensky-network.org/api/flights/arrival?airport=KSFO..etc...

    4.  Implement the functionality described above, using data
        fetched dynamically from the Arrivals-By-Airport API
        described here:

          https://openskynetwork.github.io/opensky-api/rest.html#arrivals-by-airport

    5.  Output any results through the main() method of
        your program so that we can easily run them.

''' ====== FAQs =====

    Q:  How do I know if my solution is correct?
    A:  Make sure you've read the prompt carefully and you're
        convinced your program does what you think it should
        in the common case. If your program does what the prompt 
        dictates, you will get full credit. We do not use an
        auto-grader, so we do not have any values for you to
        check correctness against.
        
    Q:  What is Delphix looking for in a solution?
    A:  After submitting your code, we'll have a pair of engineers
        evaluate it and determine next steps in the interview process.
        We are looking for correct, easy-to-read, robust code.
        Specifically, ensure your code is idiomatic and laid out
        logically. Ensure it is correct. Ensure it handles all edge
        cases and error cases elegantly.
        
    Q:  If I need a clarification, who should I ask?
    A:  Send all questions to the email address that sent you
        this document, and an engineer at Delphix will get
        back to you ASAP (we're pretty quick during normal
        business hours).

    Q:  How long should this question take me?
    A:  Approximately 1 hour, but it could take more or less
        depending on your experience with web APIs and the
        language you choose.

    Q:  When is this due?
    A:  We will begin grading your answer 24 hours after it is
        sent to you, so that is the deadline.
        
    Q:  What if something comes up and I cannot complete the
        problem during the 24 hours?
    A:  Reach out to us and let us know! We will work with you
        to figure out an extension if necessary.

    Q:  How do I turn in my solution?
    A:  Anything you've typed into this document will be saved.
        If you were given a Takehome question, there should be a Submit
        Button in the bottom right of the coderpad page. If you do not
        see such a button, feel free to email us when you are done with
        your solution. We will respond confirming we've received the
        solution within 24 hours.

    Q:  Can I use any external resources to help me?
    A:  Absolutely! Feel free to use any online resources you
        like, but please don't collaborate with anyone else.

    Q:  Can I use my favorite library in my program?
    A:  Unfortunately, there is no way to load external
        libraries into CoderPad, so you must stick to what
        they provide out of the box for your language:

            https://coderpad.io/languages

        If you really want to use something that's not
        available, email the address that sent you this link
        and we will work with you to find a solution.

    Q:  Can I code this up in a different IDE?
    A:  Of course! However, we do not have your environment
        to run your code in. We ask that you submit your final
        code via CoderPad (and make sure it can run). This gives
        our graders the ability to run your code rather than guessing.

    Q:  Why does my program terminate unexpectedly in
        CoderPad, and why can't I read from stdin or pass
        arguments on the command line?
    A:  CoderPad places a limit on the runtime and amount of
        output your code can use, but you should be able to
        make your code fit within those limits. You can hard
        code any arguments or inputs to the program in your
        main() method or in your tests.

    Q:  I'm a Vim/Emacs fan -- is there any way to use those
        keybindings? What about changing the tab width? Font
        size?
    A:  Yes! Hit the button at the bottom of the screen that
        looks like a keyboard.
