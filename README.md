# Projects:
There are a couple of projects here as an example of what I can do. 
They are probably not adhering to any code standard, as I wrote most of them at different times and generally for myself, rather than for public viewing. 
But they are listed here if you are interested. 

I'll put more formal portfolio projects in a folder labled as such, and personal projects in a folder with that name. 

# Portfolio Projects
Included is:
* A set of take home problems and live coding sessions I created as a part of my Delphix interviews. 
* A .feature file with test cases for a mock "admin role invites new user" feature.
* An example of the classic FizzBuzz problem. Done from memory and within 30 minutes.

# Personal Projects
Included:
* A utility set for the Mongoose 2nd ed Traveller and/or Cepheus Engine RPG.There are sector generators, system editors, character creator/editors, NPC generators, a bunch of tables from various books old and new, some generators I found online.
